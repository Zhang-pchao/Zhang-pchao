# Hi, I'm Pengchao Zhang 👋

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Combustion Energy, Department of Energy and Power Engineering, Tsinghua University. My work explores how interfacial ion distributions shape physicochemical processes and how machine learning accelerates molecular simulations. This repository powers my GitHub profile and serves as a hub for my academic highlights and open-source activities.

## 📊 Open-Source & Research Metrics

![GitHub Metrics](./github-metrics.svg)

The metrics panel above is generated by the [lowlighter/metrics](https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics) GitHub Action. Configure a fine-grained personal access token with the `public_repo` scope (or `repo` for private data) and save it as `METRICS_TOKEN` in your repository secrets to activate scheduled updates.

## 🛠️ Tooling & Automation

- **Automated Profile Metrics** – A scheduled workflow builds `github-metrics.svg` with contribution graphs, repository statistics, and scholarly metrics when the `METRICS_TOKEN` secret is available.
- **Dependency Maintenance with Renovate** – The `renovate.json` configuration keeps automation ready for any future code-based projects hosted in this profile repository.

## 🤝 Connect

I am always open to scientific collaboration and discussions about interfacial chemistry, molecular simulations, and AI-driven sampling strategies. Feel free to reach out through GitHub issues or pull requests.
