# Hi, I'm Pengchao Zhang ðŸ‘‹

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Combustion Energy, Department of Energy and Power Engineering, Tsinghua University. My work investigates how interfacial ion distributions steer physicochemical phenomena and how machine learning accelerates enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics. This repository powers my GitHub profile and curates my academic highlights alongside open-source activities.
